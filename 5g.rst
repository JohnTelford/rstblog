The cellular industry is saying 2020 was  going to be the year of 5G. 
It will change the way we live, work, learn, play, and improve our global society. 
Whoopee!

It is at least one year late. Oh wait, some in the industry are now saying maybe in the early 2020s. 

Hype is the space between fact and fiction. 
The Hype storm that 5G is generating, is awesome. 


The fiction is quickly climbing up the slope to  the Peak of Inflated Expectations. 
Then it will slide down to the Trough of Disillusionment until it it begins to climb the Slope of Enlightenment and becomes reality.

Most of 5G marketing is  Fiction, until the technology reaches the Slope of Enlightenment on the

Wi-Fi Generations
-----------------

5G  is the very fast wireless speed  your smartphone may one day connects to the Internet. 
This graphic show the *G* generations tree. 

.. note:: 

   5G is not just an upgrade from 4G. 5G require new phone hardware and software, new towers with new hardware, and big changes to current phone and network designs. 

The core of new technologies are industry standards. 
It seems that 5G standards are in a state of flux. 
Already, some early 5G deployments need a makeover because of standards changing.


Wi-Fi Generations
-----------------

* 1G

   First generation of broadband cellular network technology +
   1982 - 2.4 Kilobits Per Second (kbps) +
   2,400 bits per second +

   1G is an analog technology and the phones generally had poor battery life and voice quality was large without much security, and would sometimes experience dropped calls

* 2G

   1992 - 64 kbps 
   64,000 bits per second 
   
   The advance in technology from 1G to 2G introduced many of the fundamental services that we still use today, such as SMS, internal roaming , conference calls, call hold, etc..


* 3G 

   1998 - 2 Megabits (Mbps) 

   2,000,000 bits per second 

   This generation set the standards for most of the wireless technology, web browsing, email, video downloading, picture sharing and other Smartphone technology

* 4G 

   2011 - 100 Megabits (Mbps) 

   100,000,000 bits per second 

   4G is a very different technology as compared to 3G and was made possible practically only because of the advancements in the technology in the last 10 years. 
   Its purpose is to provide high speed , high quality and high capacity to users while improving security and lower the cost of voice and data services, multimedia and internet.

      5G

* 5G 

   20 Gigabits Per Second (Gbps)?

   5G is not just an upgrade from 4G. 

   5G is a generation currently under development , that's intended to improve on 4G. 
   5G promises significantly faster data rates, higher connection density, much lower latency, among other improvements.
