   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Tech Talk Blog
==============

.. note::

   - Version: 0.0.1
   - Work in Progress
   - Blog posts are opinionated, uplifting or depressing,  facts or fiction technologies, I find in my frequent panning of the Computer, Electronic, and Internet info rubble

Since the early days of the Internet, I have built blogs and web sites from scratch or used  technology du jour. This blog is built using `aBlog <https://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_. It is a `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_  extension. Sphinx uses `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_  as its markup language, and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing and translating using the `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ suit,

.. `toctree` directive, below, contains list of non-post `.rst` files.
   This is how they appear in Navigation sidebar. Note that directive
   also contains `:hidden:` option so that it is not included inside the page.

   Posts are excluded from this directive so that they aren't double listed
   in the sidebar both under Navigation and Recent Posts.
