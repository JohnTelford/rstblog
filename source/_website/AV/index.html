<p>AV (Autonomous Vehicles) are also known as self-driving.</p>
<p>There are six levels (0-5) of car autonomy from “no automation” to “full automation” :ref: <a class="reference internal" href="#levels-of-driving-automation">Levels of Driving Automation</a>.  Most of us are driving Level 0, no automation, or Level 1, driver assistance AV. A few like Tesla that are ranked at Level 2, partial Assistance. Fewer like the Audi A8 are ranked at Level 3, conditional assistance. The prophecy is some Level 4 AV are being tested on public roads. There are a few full AV Level 5 concept AV being tested. Honda and Tesla are are promoting AV Level 5 is soon to be available.</p>
<p>Technology leaps are needed before AV can interact with humans and handle novel situations gracefully.</p>
<p>There are other challenges. AI (Artificial Intelligence) used in AV comes with some drawbacks. AI struggles when it deals with something it hasn’t learned. It is hard to deal the with the unpredictable, stupid, and crazy things human drivers, pedestrians and animals do. When a AV makes an ill-advised decision, it’s extremely difficult to debug the vehicles. Unlike an airplane black box.</p>
<p>AV will need fifth generation wireless, 5G <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1">1</a>, widely deployed before they are self-diving. There are major 5G problems to be solved before AV can be truly be AV. Consumer 5G smartphones will have similar problems.</p>

<h2>Defects are Lurking<a class="headerlink" href="#defects-are-lurking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I like the idea of being delivered to my destination by AVs (Autonomous Vehicles). Spoiler Alert: There are no AVs for sale. Some of the vendors AVs hype storms are quieting down as reality set in. See Autonomous Vehicles</p>
<p>My primary concern about AVs is developing, testing, and updating hardware and software. Defects in computer systems is the way of things. They are lurking in AVs hardware, component, and software stacks that are built with various vendor products. The stacks are evolving. Vendors do a herculean task of creating, testing, and updating their products. Some more than others. Fixing defects with updates is a fact of computer technology.</p>
<p>Updating may be AVs Achilles heal. Use Microsoft as an example. It has been developing, selling, and updating software since 1975. It became market-dominate in selling PC compatible operating systems and office software suite markets. Microsoft updates still stumble sometimes. Some PC users and business IT staff dread Update Tuesday because of the collateral damage updates may inflict <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id5" id="id2">2</a> , but users and staff do not usually die.</p>

<h3>Human driver monitors the driving<a class="headerlink" href="#human-driver-monitors-the-driving" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Level 0 - No Automation</dt><dd><p>Most vehicles are at this level today. They are vehicles where the driver does everything. The human driver controls all aspects of driving – from steering to operating the pedals, monitoring surroundings, navigating, and determining when to signal or maneuver. The car may have some automated warning tones and automated emergency braking.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Level 1 - Driver Assistance</dt><dd><p>“The driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of either steering or acceleration/deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver perform all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task.” - SAE J3016</p>
<p>Vehicles with this level of autonomy, in some driving modes, can handle steering or throttle and braking – but never both. Most functions are controlled by the driver. However, there are some systems that will step in to control the car. These might keep the car in its lane without input from the driver. Or they might brake the car and accelerate to maintain a set speed and distance in relation to the car in front. The driver is still primarily in control and these systems don’t work together. Even when the car is making decisions, the driver must be ready to step in at any moment. AV with radar assisted ‘active cruise control’ fall into this category.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p>Level 2 - Partial Assistance</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver perform all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task.” - SAE J3016</p>
<p>More than one system works together governing acceleration/deceleration and steering by using information gathered by the car from the driving environment. The driver performs all other elements of driving and remains in total control of the car. This might be a car that has radar-assisted cruise control working with Lane Keep Assist.</p>
<p>Vehicles can handle the steering and throttle and braking in some driving modes at Level 2. The driver must be alert at all times, be ready to take over the control of the vehicle, and is still responsible for monitoring the surroundings, traffic and road conditions.</p>
<p>An example of Level 2 autonomy is Tesla’s Autopilot system. This is a suite of driver assistance technologies including Traffic Aware Cruise Control and Auto-steer with lane change, which enables automatic steering on undivided roads but with speed restrictions.</p>
<p>Other AV that have Level 2 systems are Volvo Pilot Assist, Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot, and Cadillac Super Cruise.</p>

<h3>Automated Driving System (“system”) Monitors The Driving Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#automated-driving-system-system-monitors-the-driving-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt>Level 3 - Conditional Assistance</dt><dd><p>“With Level 3 autonomy, the vehicle can monitor its surroundings, change lanes, and can control the steering, throttle and braking in certain situations, such as on motorways. However, the driver must be ready to take back control of the vehicle when required.” - SAE J3016</p>
<p>This level of autonomy has been termed conditional automation. An automated driving system that takes over all aspects of the driving process. It assess conditions around the car, accelerate, decelerate and even change lane without any human input. However, the driver must still be on hand and ready to intervene if the car requests it. Crucially, the human doesn’t have to be paying attention as much as in the previous levels.</p>
<p>The Audi A8 is the first production car to have Level 3 autonomy. Unfortunately regulators currently prohibit Level 3 autonomy. The A8′s AI Traffic Jam Pilot manages starting, steering, throttle and braking in slow-moving traffic at up to 60km/h on major roads where a physical barrier separates the two carriageways. When the system reaches its limits the driver is alerted to take over the driving.</p>
<p>Audi has said it will use a step-by-step approach to the introduction of the traffic jam pilot in its production models, because of local laws and regulations regarding autonomous diving.</p>

<li><p>Level 4 - High Automation</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene” - SAE J3016</p>
<p>These AV are probably what we think of when someone says the words ‘autonomous vehicle’</p>
<p>Level 4 automated AV can drive themselves with a human driver onboard. The car takes control of the starting, steering throttle and braking as well as monitoring its surroundings in a wide range of environments and handling the parking duties.</p>
<p>When the conditions are right, the driver can switch the car to autonomous mode. When the vehicle encounters something that it cannot read or handle it will request the assistance of the driver.</p>
<p>However, even if the driver does not intervene and something goes wrong, the car will continue to maneuver autonomously.</p>
<p>These AV are truly self-driving and the Google/Waymo self-driving vehicle has been tested at this level of autonomy on public roads for some time.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Level 5 - Full Automation</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene” - SAE J3016</p>
<p>The vehicle does not need human control. Humans are nothing but cargo. It doesn’t need to have pedals, or a steering wheel, or a human onboard.</p>
<p>The car is fully automated and can do all driving tasks on any road, under any conditions, whether there’s a human on board or not.</p>
<p>Some concept AV are Level 5 AV – including the Volkswagen Group SeDriC (SElf-DRIving Car), above, and the Audi AIcon concept.”</p>
