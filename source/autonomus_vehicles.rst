There are no AV for sale
------------------------

AV (Autonomus Vehicles) are also known as self-driving.

There are six levels (0-5) of car autonomy from “no automation” to “full automation.” Most of us are driving Level 0, no automation, or Level 1, driver assistance AV. A few like Tesla that are ranked at Level 2, partial Assistance. Fewer like the Audi A8 are ranked at Level 3, conditional assistance. The prophecy is some Level 4 AV are being tested on public roads. There are a few full AV Level 5 concept AV being tested. Honda and Tesla are are promoting AV Level 5 is soon to be available. 

Technology leaps are needed before AV can interact with humans and handle novel situations gracefully.

There are other challenges. AI (Artificial Intelligence) used in AV comes with some drawbacks. AI struggles when it deals with something it hasn’t learned. It is hard to deal the with the unpredictable, stupid, and crazy things human drivers and pedestrians do. When a AV makes an ill-advised decision, it’s extremely difficult to debug the vehicles. Unlike an airplane black box.

AV will need fifth generation wireless, 5G, widely deployed before they are self-diving. There are major 5G problems to be solved before AV can be truly be AV. Consumer 5G smartphones will have similar problems. See 5G and Atonomous Vehicles

Defects are Lurking
-------------------

I like the idea of being delivered to my destination by AVs (Atonmomus Vehicles). Spoiler Alert: There are no AVs for sale. Some of the vendors AVs hype storms are quieting down as reality set in. See Autonomus Vehicles

My primary concern about AVs is developing, testing, and updating hardware and software. Defects in computer systems is the way of things. They are lurking in AVs hardware, component, and software stacks that are built with various vendor products. The stacks are evolving. Vendors do a herculean task of creating, testing, and updating their products. Some more than others. Fixing defects with updates is a fact of computer technology.

Updating may be AVs Achilles heal. Use Microsoft as an example. It has been developing, selling, and updating software since 1975. It became market-dominate in selling PC compatible operating systems and office software suite markets. Microsoft updates still stumble sometimes. Some PC users and business IT staff dread Update Tuesday because of the collateral damage updates may inflict, but users and staff do not usually die.
