Some command line  utilities I find useful are:

- ``fd`` is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to ``find``

- ``gitui`` is a blazing fast terminal client for ``git`` written in Rust

- ``rip`` a safe and ergonomic alternative to ``rm``

- ``rg`` ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern
