`WebAssembly - Mozilla Research <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly>`_ "WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers â€” it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++ and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together."
