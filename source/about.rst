About 
======

Since the early days of the Internet, I have built blogs from scratch or used blog technology du jour. This blog is built using `aBlog <https://ablog.readthedocs.io>`_. It is a `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_  extension. Sphinx uses `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_  as its markup language, and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing and translating using the `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ suit,  

The Internet has been a part my life since its early days. I have decades of hands-on experience with some of the ever changing Electronic, Internet, and Software technologies, and a passion pursuing what’s new and improved within the these industries

Checking out what’s new or not, what’s real or not, or what’s new and improved, is something like panning for gold. Buried within the mountains of info rubble produced daily, every so often one finds nuggets making the effort worthwhile.

These industries are probably the fastest changing endeavors mankind has ever created. The half life of many products making it to market are relatively short. There are some very short lived and some that were just vapor.
