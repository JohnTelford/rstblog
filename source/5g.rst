   - Work in Progress


The cellular industry is saying 2020 was  going to be the year of 5G. 
It will change the way we live, work, learn, play, and improve our global society. 
Whoopee!

Oh wait, some in the industry are now saying maybe time in the  2020s. 

Hype is the space between fact and fiction. 
The Hype storm that 5G is generating, is awesome. 

Most of 5G marketing is  Fiction, until the technology reaches the **Slope of Enlightenment** on the :ref:`Hype Cycle`

The 5G fiction is quickly climbing up the slope to  the peak of **Inflated Expectations**. 
Then it will slide down to the **Trough of Disillusionment** until it it begins to climb the **Slope of Enlightenment** and becomes reality.


Cellular Networks Generations
-----------------------------

.. note:: 

   5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks. It is very different than 4G and older wireless standards. It is extremely fast, require new phone hardware and software,  new towers with new hardware, and big changes to  phone and network designs. 
 
   It is the very fast  speed  your smartphone may some day use to connect to the Internet.

   *G* Generations

- **1G**  1982 - 2.4 kbps - Retired

   First generation of broadband cellular network technology - Retired

   1G is an analog technology and the phones generally had poor battery life and voice quality was large without much security, and would sometimes experience dropped calls


- **2G**   1992 - 64 kbps - Retired

   The advance in technology from 1G to 2G introduced many of the fundamental services that we still use today, such as SMS, internal roaming , conference calls, call hold, etc..


- **3G**    1998 - 2 Mbps - Soon to be Retired

   This generation set the standards for most of the wireless technology, web browsing, email, video downloading, picture sharing and other Smartphone technology


- **4G**    2011 - 100 Mbps

   4G is a very different technology as compared to 3G and was made possible practically only because of the advancements in the technology in the last 10 years. 
   Its purpose is to provide high speed , high quality and high capacity to users while improving security and lower the cost of voice and data services, multimedia and internet.


- **5G**    10 Gbps?

   5G is not just an upgrade from 4G. 5G promises significantly faster data rates, higher connection density, much lower latency, among other improvements.

5G Technology Goals
:::::::::::::::::::



The core of new networking technologies are build using industry standards. The 5G standards are in a state of flux. Some early 5G deployments are doing makeovers because  standard  changes

There is a lot of excitement over 5G’s promise of blazing speeds, lower latencies, and more robust security than 3G and 4G networks. However,  network operator have their own timetable for rolling out the next-generation cellular technology. 5G will  be a patchwork of 3G, 4G, and 5G networks.  For the next few years, 5G won’t be able to fully deliver on its promises.

   5G Technology Goals

Realizing these  three 5G technology goals is more complex than previous generations. Some of the necessary technology may not exist or be experimental, fewer engineers and technicians have the necessary skills, high cost of deployment, consumers may balk at higher product and service costs, and limited coverage


Three Kinds of 5G
:::::::::::::::::

Blazing speeds require using higher-frequency radio waves than 4G cellular networks

5G is an umbrella term. There are now 3 bands of radio-frequency spectrum of 5G, and likely additional  bands at higher frequencies will be added. 

The capability of of 5G signals penetrating atmospheric, automobiles, buildings, glass, pockets, purses, vegetation, walls, and other obstacles, decreases at higher bands and frequencies



Low-Band
........

Low-band 5G uses a similar frequency range to current 4G cellphones giving download speeds a little higher than 4G. Low-band 5G cell towers will have a range and coverage area similar to current 4G towers.

Medium-Band
...........

Mid-band 5G uses microwaves frequencies, currently allowing speeds of 100-900 Mbit/s, with each cell tower providing service up to several miles in radius.

High-Band
.........

High-band 5G currently uses frequencies near the bottom of the millimeter wave band, although higher frequencies may be used in the future. It may achieves download speeds of a gigabit per second (Gbit/s), comparable to cable internet.

Bottom Line
...........

This quote from Tom Wheeler a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  "If anyone tells you they know the details of what 5G will deliver, walk the other way." [#]_ may sum up contemporary 5G reality.

So, the bottom line is will consumers  jump on the rising **Inflated Expectation** part of the 5G :ref:`Hype Cycle`  only to experience falling to the **Trough of Disillusionment**, or wait for the **Slope of Enlightenment** when they understand the technology better and how it may benefit them?


Some Dreams of 5G
-----------------

5G Dreams [#]_



   - Broadband Internet Everywhere
   - Smart Vehicles, Cities, and Factories
   - Immersive AR and VR
   - Everything Is On-Demand
   - Smarter Healthcare
   - Better Law Enforcement
   - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication
   - etc..

Some day, some dreams may come true
