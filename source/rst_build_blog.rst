Sphinx-doc
==========

Sphinx [#]_ is web site generator for creating web sites and other types of documentation. It requires using Markdown [#]_, or :ref:`reStructuredText` which is  a  user-friendly, plain text markup language,  for editing web site and other text material. 



reStructuredText
================

reStructuredText [#]_  is a lightweight markup language that is used in static site generators like Sphinx [1]_. Sphinx requires using Markdown or reStructuredText for text material editing. This web site is an example of using reStructuredText and Spninx. 

Sphinx contains robust tools for semantic markup, reusing content, and content filters for different kinds of outputs.

Compared to some other lightweight markup languages like Markdown, reStructuredText contains stronger semantic markup tools. Some writers also prefer reStructuredText because the markup standards are more well-defined compared to MarkDown

reStructuredText is an easy-to-read,  plaintext markup syntax and parser system. A useful feature of Sphinx is one can see the reStructuredText used to create a web page by clicking on "Page source" in the lower right corner of a web page. I used this to speed up learning Sphinx. I think reStructuredText is easier to read than markdown.

It is useful for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents

"Structured Text" is probably a bit of a misnomer. It's more like "Relaxed Text" that uses certain consistent patterns. These patterns are interpreted by a HTML converter to produce "Very Structured Text" that can be used by a web browser

reStructuredText is the default plaintext markup language for Sphinx and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils [#]_
