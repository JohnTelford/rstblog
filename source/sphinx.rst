Sphinx is a  web site generator framework that abstracts  Markdown or reStructuredText  text editing language, producing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  for browsers to render web sites using builtin interpreters.

This blog is an example of using Sphinx and reStructuredText

Compared to some other lightweight markup languages like MarkDown, reStructuredText contains stronger semantic markup tools. Some writers  prefer reStructuredText because the markup standards are more well-defined compared to MarkDown

"Structured Text" may be  inaccurate.  “Relaxed Text” may be a better description. It uses  consistent patterns that are compiled to HTML  to produce “Very Structured Text” HTML, along with CSS, and JavaScript components

HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. 

   - HTML  provides the structure of a web page

   - CSS provides the visual layout
   
   - HTML and CSS are the basis of building web pages and  Applications

   - JavaScript provides functionality
